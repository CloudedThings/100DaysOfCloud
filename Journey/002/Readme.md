# [Build Your Infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation and the AWS CDK](https://build-infra-cfn-cdk.workshop.aws/en/)

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è This is a AWS official Workshop. Part I

This AWS CloudFormation template deploys a reference architecture that includes:

1. [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/) Data Streams, which stores the incoming streaming data
2. [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/?kinesis-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&kinesis-blogs.sort-order=desc), which buffers the data before delivering the output to an Amazon S3 bucket. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration.
3. An [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) dashboard monitors the data ingestion and buffering. CloudWatch alarms are set on essential metrics for Kinesis Data Firehose.

For purposes of the workshop, we‚Äôll simulate a customer-facing app with a simple containerized application that will stream data into the ingestion pipeline.

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è AWS Account

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è Streaming Data for Amazon Kinesis (SampleProducer is a Java application that uses the [Kinesis Producer Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-kpl.html) to send messages at a configurable rate for a configurable duration in seconds.

  We‚Äôll build this application into a Docker container, push it to the [Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) so it can be deployed to Fargate containers)

- ‚úçÔ∏è 

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è The AWS Solution Implementation library has several solutions for [Streaming Data for Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-streaming-data-solution-for-amazon-kinesis/?did=sl_card&trk=sl_card), and Option 3 has just the solution that will accelerate our use case.

## Try yourself

‚úçÔ∏è 

### Step 1 ‚Äî Create an Cloud9 environment

Log in to your AWS account ant then navigate to Cloud9 and create an environment.

![002_create_cloud9.jpg](img/002_create_cloud9.jpg)

Then make sure that environment has the latest Node version by running:

```
nvm install v14.17.6
```

### Step 2 ‚Äî Initialize the CDK Project

Create a new folder and initialize the AWS CDK CLI to create a project:

```
mkdir streaming-app && cd streaming-app
npx cdk@1.125.0 init --language=typescript ap
```

Then install AWS dependencies

```
npm install
```

In order to deploy our CDK application we first need to bootstrap our account.

```
npx cdk bootstrap
```

### Step 3 ‚Äî Download and review the CloudFormation template

Run the following command:

```
mkdir templates
curl https://solutions-reference.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-streaming-data-solution-for-amazon-kinesis/v1.5.0/aws-streaming-data-solution-for-kinesis-using-kinesis-data-firehose-and-amazon-s3.template -o templates/aws-kinesis-streaming-solution.json
```



### Step 4 ‚Äî Create resources from template in CDK application

Create a new file for our ingestion pipeline construct.

```
touch lib/ingestion-pipeline.ts
```

And use the following code:

```
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as include from '@aws-cdk/cloudformation-include';

import * as path from 'path';

export class IngestionPipeline extends cdk.Construct {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    const template = new include.CfnInclude(this, 'Template', {
      templateFile: path.join(__dirname, '../templates/aws-kinesis-streaming-solution.json'),
      parameters: {
        ShardCount: 2,
        RetentionHours: 24,
        EnableEnhancedMonitoring: 'false',
        BufferingSize: 5,
        CompressionFormat: 'GZIP',
      },
      preserveLogicalIds: false,
    });
    
  }
}
```

Create a CDK Stack that will allow us to deploy the infrastructure.

```
touch lib/ingestion-pipeline-stack.ts
```

```
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { IngestionPipeline } from './ingestion-pipeline';

export class IngestionPipelineStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new IngestionPipeline(this, 'IngestionPipeline');
  }
}
```

Now add the stack to our entry point, and make sure to update the env parameter for both stacks.

Edit bin/streaming-app.ts

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
import 'source-map-support/register';
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { StreamingAppStack } from '../lib/streaming-app-stack';
import { IngestionPipelineStack } from '../lib/ingestion-pipeline-stack';

const app = new cdk.App();
new IngestionPipelineStack(app, 'IngestionPipelineStack', {
  env: {
    account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT,
    region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION,
  },
});
new StreamingAppStack(app, 'StreamingAppStack', {
  env: {
    account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT,
    region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION,
  },
});
```

### Step 5 ‚Äî Deploy resources

Run following command to see what will be deployed

```
npx cdk diff
```

![002_cdk_deploy.jpg](img/002_cdk_deploy.jpg)

run `cdk deploy` to create the ingestion pipeline.

```
npx cdk deploy --all
```

This will create the resources for the ingestion pipeline stack

![002_ingestion_pipeline_stack_complete.jpg](img/002_ingestion_pipeline_stack_complete.jpg)

And additional stack called **StreamingAppStack** that will be build in next steps.

### Step 6 ‚Äî Build the streaming application with the CDK

The ingestion pipeline needs data to ingest. Create our streaming producer application that will stream data into our ingestion pipeline. 

```
touch lib/streaming-producer.ts
```

Paste the following code:

```
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';

export class StreamingProducer extends cdk.Construct {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    // The code that defines your construct goes here
  }
}
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

‚úçÔ∏è I learn what AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is and how it can be used with CloudFormation

:exclamation: In order to create a streaming producer component I needed a Kinesis Producer Library Dockerfile which wasn't provided with the workshop - here I paused the Workshop by downloading the environment locally.

## Next Steps

‚úçÔ∏è In next part I will try to implement the KPL to simulate data streams.
